<!-- Q.12
Find common elements in three sorted arrays.
Given three arrays sorted in increasing order. Find the elements that are common in all three arrays.
Note:Â can you take care of the duplicates without using any additional Data Structure?
Example 1:
Input:
n1 = 6; A = {1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80}
n2 = 5; B = {6, 7, 20, 80, 100}
n3 = 8; C = {3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120}
Output: 20 80
Explanation: 20 and 80 are the only
common elements in A, B and C.-->
